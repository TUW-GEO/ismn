The program will iterate through **all** files and collect information such as station names, sensor time coverage, measurement depths, landcover/climate classes, soil properties etc. for each sensor. Depending on the number of files and whether zipped/extracted files are provided, this step can take a while. A log file is created in the displayed path. Parallel processing for this step can be activated manually by choosing `ISMN_Interface(data_path, parallel=True)` and will speed up metadata collection significantly. By default this step will create a folder called `python_metadata` (which contains the collected metadata as a `.csv` file) and place it inside the passed root directory. The next time the reader is created it will use `python_metadata` (if it is found) instead of generating it again (a different path to generate and search the metadata in can be passed via `ISMN_Interface(data_path, meta_path='/custom/meta/path')`.\n",

Otherwise all networks stored under the given path are loaded.
